# Digital Library Feature Documentation

## Overview

The Digital Library feature integrates free open educational resources for JAMB preparation into the Nigerian Educational Analytics Dashboard. It allows users to discover, filter, and save learning materials across multiple subjects in the JAMB curriculum.

## Features

### 1. Resource Discovery
- Browse resources by subject and topic
- Filter by resource type (books, videos, practice questions, etc.)
- Access materials from trusted open educational platforms

### 2. Supported JAMB Subjects
- English Language
- Mathematics
- Physics
- Chemistry
- Biology
- Government
- Literature
- Economics

### 3. Resource Sources
- OpenStax
- Khan Academy
- LibreTexts
- YouTube EDU (curated educational videos)
- JAMB eLearning (official resources)

### 4. Personalization
- Save favorite resources for quick access
- Resources are cached locally for faster loading
- Persistent storage of saved materials

## Technical Implementation

### Resource Integration
The system integrates with educational resources through:
- Direct links to relevant content sections
- Curated paths to specific JAMB-relevant materials
- Topic-specific resource mapping

### Data Management
- Client-side storage for saved resources
- Server-side caching (24-hour expiry)
- Resource metadata standardization

### Interface Design
- Card-based resource display
- Visual differentiation by resource type
- Responsive design for mobile compatibility

## Usage Guide

### For Students
1. Select your subject of interest from the dropdown
2. Choose a specific topic (optional)
3. Filter by resource type if desired
4. Browse available resources
5. Click "Access Resource" to open in a new tab
6. Click "Save" to add to your personal collection

### For Educators
1. Discover teaching materials across subjects
2. Use filters to find level-appropriate content
3. Save collections of resources by topic
4. Recommend specific resources to students

## Implementation Notes

### Resource Filtering Logic
Resources are filtered in two stages:
1. Subject-level filtering (primary)
2. Topic and type filtering (secondary)

### Resource Caching
Resources are cached to improve performance:
- Initial load pulls from OER sources
- Subsequent visits use cached data if available
- Cache automatically refreshes every 24 hours

### Mock Data vs. Production
The current implementation uses structured mock data that closely resembles what would be available from the actual APIs. In a production environment, this would be replaced with:

1. Direct API calls to educational platforms where available
2. Web scraping with proper attribution for publicly available resources
3. Regular updates to ensure resource availability

## Future Enhancements

1. **Enhanced Resource Discovery**
   - Full-text search across all resources
   - AI-powered resource recommendations
   - Difficulty level filters

2. **User Contributions**
   - Allow users to suggest new resources
   - Community ratings and reviews
   - Study group resource sharing

3. **Content Integration**
   - Direct in-platform viewing of compatible content
   - Interactive practice questions
   - Progress tracking across learning resources

4. **Resource Evaluation**
   - Quality assessment metrics
   - Alignment with current JAMB syllabus
   - User success correlation analysis
